# Q Applet: Stack Overflow

This applet notifies for unread inbox items from a Stackoverflow account by
making a Das Keyboard Q key blink in blue.

Stack Overflow is a question and answer site for professional and enthusiast programmers. It's built and run by you as part of the Stack Exchange network of Q&A sites. With your help, we're working together to build a library of detailed answers to every question about programming.
